Easy:
Factory has to wait for production and storage space

Medium:
Synchronization between factory and warlock and sorcerer
In the factory you have to check if its cursed, if its not then you can start production.
Warlock is adding curses and Sorcerer is removing them.

Upper-Medium:
Synchronization between alchemists. Here you have to wait for several things at the same time,
check whether you can be served or not (if yes then you do something), if you cannot be served
then you wait (and process should be sleeping until both resources are available, you wake
the process just once). Its not that who comes first then he is served first (in case if 
waiting is not necessary). 
You should avoid starvation (especially for the guy who uses all three resources).
Do not wake a process if it cannot be served!

You should not be blocking processess if they do not have to wait! 
(dont block everything and serve everything one by one).
